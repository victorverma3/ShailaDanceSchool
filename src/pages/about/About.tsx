        Shaila Verma is a trained Bharatnatyam dancer and has been dancing since
        the age of five. She is the artistic director of the Shaila School Of

        inspire their creative dance talent and build their confidence, as well
        as a strong foundation for their dance education. Not only does she
        teach her students dance forms, but she also teaches them
